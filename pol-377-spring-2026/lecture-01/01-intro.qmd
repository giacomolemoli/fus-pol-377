- I am at Franklin since November 2025. Before, I have lived, studied and worked in Italy, the US, and France

- If you are curious about my background, you can check [my website](https://giacomolemoli.com/)

. . . 

How to reach me:

- Office: LAC 8
- Office hours: Tuesdays and Fridays before class, 12.30pm-2.30pm

## Our goals

In this course, the goal is that you

- Learn about current topics and debates in IPE

- "Think as a social scientist" when interpreting news and events: critically and with analytical rigor

- Draw lessons from history 

. . . 

To do so, I want us to communicate as much as possible during the course

- This is an interactive course and you will do most of the job in class

- Use office hours to clarify doubts, ask questions, discuss progress

- I am also interested in continued feedback from you about the course




## About you

I want you to tell everyone, in a few words:

- Your name
- The place you call "home"
- Your first memory related to international politics or economics (broadly defined)


# Course overview {.section}

## What is IPE about?

International Political Economy (IPE): the study of interactions between economics and politics in the world economy

This definition encompasses different levels of analysis:

1. <u>Relations between states</u>: states are "autonomous" agents that interact with others

    - e.g., take part in international institutions, trade, sign treaties

2. <u>Domestic sources of international politics</u>: what drives states' posture in relations between states 
    - e.g., accountability to, and representation of, domestic voters and special interests

3. <u>International sources of domestic politics</u>: the repercussions of international events or trends in domestic societies and electorates 
    - e.g., economic transformations, political changes


## Our approach in this course

IPE is a subfield at the intersection of political science and economics. We will look at the world through the glasses of analytical (quantitative) political science

- We will learn how (many if not most) contemporary political scientist analyze complex macro-level phenomena

- That is, dissecting them into component parts within a unifying framework: rational choice

- In short: people, politicians, governments, states... (*actors*) have goals and motivations and behave (*act*) according to them. In order to understand their behavior we need to start from what drives them

- The goal is to generate knowledge of facts that is generalizable across space and time

. . . 

Important: mathematical or statistical training is neither necessary nor required for this class. Our focus is on understanding and applying concepts

## What is IPE

> We can view international political economy as the intersection of the substantive area studied by economics -- production and exchange of marketable means of want satisfaction -- with the process by which power is exercised that is central to politics.
>
> Keohane (1984, Ch. 2)


## Liberalism

::::

- The core actors are individuals as producers and consumers

- Free trade is a ["positive-sum"]{.hover-note data-tooltip="This means that all parties can derive a net benefit from trade. In constrast, zero-sum means that total benefits are zero, so someone's gains must be someone else's losses."} game which makes all parties involved better off

- Free markets are the most efficient way to allocate resources

- Economics and politics are autonomous domains (and should not be mixed)

- The government's role should be limited to setting "fair" rules of the game and provide public goods (e.g., property rights protection, defense...) so that the market can flourish

- Absence of conflict is natural: mutual economic interest from trade prevents wars



## Marxism

:::
::::

- The core actors are the classes: capitalists (owners of means of production) and workers (owners of labor)

- The economic-political system is shaped by capitalism and conflicting economic interests

- Politics is subordinated to economic forces

- Capitalism expands globally to find new markets and exploitable labor $\implies$ imperialism

- Capitalism creates a hierarchical international system (core-periphery). This system maintains peripheral countries underdeveloped

- Conflict is natural



## Realism

![Carl von Clausewitz](img/Clausewitz.jpg){width="50%"}
:::
::::


- The core actors are the states

- States' decisions are driven by power, its use and the desire to increase it relative to other states

- Economics is subordinated to political forces 

- States can undermine free trade (e.g., reduce their engagement or monopolize parts of the economy) if this can strengthen their power vis-a-vis other states in other ways

- Absence of conflict is possible if a single actor is so powerful to enforce rules $\implies$ Hegemonic stability



## (New) Institutionalism

:::
::::

- The core actors are states

- States have common interests, but self-interest prevents from pursuing it 

- They create **institutions** (codified "rules of the game") to enforce cooperation for mutual benefit

- Economics and politics interact through the incentives and rational choices of states

- Absence of conflict (cooperation) is not natural, but can be achieved




## The rational choice approach

All traditional theories provide important, sometimes crucial, insights. In contemporary political science, the prevailing methodological framework (and the defining methodological framework of economics) is [rational choice]{.alert}

[New Institutionalist theory is an example of rational choice theory]{.remark}

. . . 

There are several advantages. We can incorporate some key insights of traditional theories

- Self-interest
- Conflicts of interest
- Inequality in power and wealth
- Interactions of politics and economics
- Institutions
- etc.


## The rational choice approach

The **rational choice** approach is built on a few general postulates:

- The <u>individual</u> is the basic unit of analysis
- Individuals have motivations (<u>preferences</u>) and <u>beliefs</u> about the world (due to uncertainty)
- Their choices are <u>constrained</u> by objective limitations or existing rules
- Individuals <u>act</u> (choose actions) according to their preferences, beliefs, and constraints

. . . 

Of course we generally don't know preferences or beliefs of others. We use *assumptions* about them to build models that can explain patterns of behavior. It is well understood that models are ["wrong but sometimes useful"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)

. . . 

Methodological individualism does **not** mean that we believe all people are selfish in a caricatural sense or have only material motivations.

[We will see that it is difficult to understand the backlash against globalization without non-material concepts such as pride, dignity, community, culture]{.remark}

Incorporating these concepts into rational choice is challenging, but many people (including the DIVIDE team) work on that all the time

The advantage of RC is to allow us to examine *what* assumptions fail in the model and to work to improve them


## Actors and relations in IPE

Recall the different "levels" of analysis. We can now give them a structure in terms of actors and relations

- We often want to "aggregate" up to the level of states or governments to study macro-phenomena

- Is it correct? It depends

- Treating states as unitary actors in a model is equivalent to assuming that who runs the state has full mandate on international issues (or that only their preferences matter)

- Whether this is justified or not depends on the specific theory 

- The RC approach helps us understand and evaluate constraints of high-level actors and the consequences of their actions

## Next

We will use the rational choice framework to understand the nature of problems that require international [cooperation]{.alert}

That is, problems where "individual" incentives may clash with collective goals (trade liberalization, climate change, etc.)
