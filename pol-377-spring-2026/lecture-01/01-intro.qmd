## About you

I want you to tell everyone, in a few words:

- Your name
- The place you call "home"
- Your first memory related to international politics or economics (broadly defined)


# Course overview {.section}

## This class

International Political Economy (IPE): the study of interactions between economics and politics in the world economy

There are different levels of analysis

1. <u>Relations between states</u> (states as "autonomous" agents): international institutions, treaties, organizations

2. <u>Domestic sources of international politics</u>: what drives states' posture in relations between states 
    - e.g., accountability and representation of domestic voters and special interests

3. <u>International sources of domestic politics</u>: the reverberations of international events or shocks into domestic societies and electorates 
    - e.g., unequal costs and benefits for different social groups


## Our approach 

IPE is a subfield at the intersection of political science and economics. We will look at the world through the glasses of analytical (quantitative) political science

- We will learn how (many if not most) contemporary political scientist analyze complex macro-level phenomena

- That is, dissecting them into component parts within a unifying framework: rational choice

- In short: people, politicians, governments, states... (*actors*) have goals and motivations and behave (*act*) according to them. In order to understand their behavior we need to start from what drives them

- The goal is to arrive at understanding of facts that is generalizable across space and time

. . . 

Important: mathematical or statistical training is neither necessary nor required for this class. Our focus is on understanding and applying concepts

## Requirements

The final grade is based on

- Midterm exam 
- Group paper presentation (2 sessions throughout the course)
- Individual research design (at the end of the course)
- Class participation

. . . 

We incorporate in the course activities with external speakers @ Franklin

# Views of IPE {.section}

## What is IPE

> We can view international political economy as the intersection of the substantive area studied by economics -- production and exchange of marketable means of want satisfaction -- with the process by which power is exercised that is central to politics.
>
> Keohane (1984, Ch. 2)


## Liberalism

::::

- The core actors are individuals as producers and consumers

- Free trade is a ["positive-sum"]{.hover-note data-tooltip="This means that all parties can derive a net benefit from trade. In constrast, zero-sum means that total benefits are zero, so someone's gains must be someone else's losses."} game which makes all parties involved better off

- Free markets are the most efficient way to allocate resources

- Economics and politics are autonomous domains (and should not be mixed)

- The government's role should be limited to setting "fair" rules of the game and provide public goods (e.g., property rights protection, defense...) so that the market can flourish

- Absence of conflict is natural: mutual economic interest from trade prevents wars



## Marxism

::::

- The core actors are the classes: capitalists (owners of means of production) and workers (owners of labor)

- The economic-political system is shaped by capitalism and conflicting economic interests

- Politics is subordinated to economic forces

- Capitalism expands globally to find new markets and exploitable labor $\implies$ imperialism

- Capitalism creates a hierarchical international system (core-periphery). This system maintains peripheral countries underdeveloped

- Conflict is natural



## Realism

![Carl von Clausewitz](img/Clausewitz.jpg){width="50%"}
:::
::::


- The core actors are the states

- States' decisions are driven by power, its use and the desire to increase it relative to other states

- Economics is subordinated to political forces 

- States can undermine free trade (e.g., reduce their engagement or monopolize parts of the economy) if this can strengthen their power vis-a-vis other states in other ways

- Absence of conflict is possible if a single actor is so powerful to enforce rules $\implies$ Hegemonic stability

:::
::::

- The core actors are states

- States have common interests, but self-interest prevents from pursuing it 

- They create **institutions** (codified "rules of the game") to enforce cooperation for mutual benefit

- Economics and politics interact thanks to the incentives and **rational choices** of states

- Absence of conflict (cooperation) is not natural, but can be achieved




## The rational choice approach

All traditional theories provide important, sometimes crucial, insights. Our approach will be to use the prevailing methodological framework in contemporary political science (and the defining methodological framework of economics): [rational choice]{.alert}

[Institutionalist theory is an example of rational choice]{.remark}

. . . 

There are several advantages. We can incorporate some key insights of traditional theories incorporated

- Self-interest
- Conflicts of interest
- Inequality in power and wealth
- Interactions of politics and economics
- Institutions
- etc.


## The rational choice approach

The **rational choice** approach is built on a few general postulates:

- The <u>individual</u> is the basic unit of analysis
- Individuals have motivations (<u>preferences</u>) and <u>beliefs</u> about the world (due to uncertainty)
- Their choices are <u>constrained</u> by objective limitations or existing rules
- Individuals <u>act</u> (choose actions) according to their preferences, beliefs, and constraints

. . . 

Of course we generally don't know preferences or beliefs of others. We use *assumptions* about them to build models that can explain patterns of behavior. It is well understood that models are ["wrong but sometimes useful"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)

. . . 

Methodological individualism does **not** mean that we believe all people are selfish in a caricatural sense or have only material motivations.

[For instance, we will see that it is difficult to understand the backlash against globalization without non-material concepts such as group, dignity, community, culture]{.remark}

Incorporating these concepts into rational choice is challenging, but many people (including the DIVIDE team) work on that all the time

We often need to "aggregate" up to the level of states or governments to understand IPE phenomena

Treating states as unitary actors in a model is equivalent to assuming that who runs the state has full mandate on international issues (or that only its preferences matter)

This may be justified or not, depending on the specific theory and phenomenon we want to explain

The RC approach helps us understand and evaluate constraints of high-level actors and the consequences of their actions

## Next

We will use the rational choice framework to understand the nature of problems that require international [cooperation]{.alert}

That is, problems where "individual" incentives may clash with collective goals (trade liberalization, climate change, etc.)
