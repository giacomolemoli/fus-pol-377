## What is globalization?

What do you think of when you think of "globalization"?

. . . 

> Globalization is the process of increasing interdependence and integration among the economies, markets, societies, and cultures of different countries worldwide. This is made possible by the reduction of barriers to international trade, the liberalization of capital movements, the development of transportation, and the advancement of information and communication technologies

## What is globalization?

Globalization is a complex phenomenon which involves the exchange of goods, services, information, technology, and people

. . . 

Many of these components have a dedicated module

In this module, we will focus on the [trade]{.alert} component of globalization

## Geography and trade

Not just physical geography, but how "fast to reach" a country is

[Pascali (2017)](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20140832) shows that the first wave of globalization (1870-1913) was facilitated by the introduction of steam engines

They drastically reduced shipping times for merchant ships, which previously could only rely on wind

. . . 

Studies that try to do causal inference on trade use some exogenous factor (related to geography) that reduces trade costs between two countries

For instance: distance, or changes in travel times as determined by changes in transport technology

# Institutions for Free Trade: GATT/WTO {.section}
<!--
## General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade

- Features that should improve trade
- Most Favored Nation clause etc
- Social dilemmas that should be solved by GATT

## World Trade Organization

## Did the GATT/WTO increase free trade?

Goldstein, Rivers, and Tomz (2007) study the effects of GATT/WTO on trade between countries

. . . 

Recap of the study:

- What is the motivation for their study? Is there a gap or puzzle they want to address?
- What is their argument regarding the effect of GATT/WTO?
- What is their research design?
- What are the units of analysis?

## Did the GATT/WTO increase free trade?

## Did the GATT/WTO increase free trade?

Do you think this study has broader implications for understanding the effects of institutions?

# The Effects of Trade {.section}

## Economic effects of trade

What do you think are the effects of trade on:

- Growth?
- Inequality?

## Does trade integration lead to the spread of democracy?

Tabellini and Magistretti (2025) study this question


- What is their research question?
- What is the **logic** of their design? What is the "treatment"? What is the "instrument"?
- What are the **mechanisms** that they suggest for the result and the ones they say they rule out?
- What are the identification assumptions? Do you find them plausible?

## Class activity

What can be the negative consequences of globalization (trade integration) on the economy? And on democracy?

## Next

- Understanding reactions to globalization: winners and losers
- The backlash against globalization today
- The rise of the radical right in Western democracies
